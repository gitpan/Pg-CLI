- The command line arguments for pg_dump and psql included -w, which only

- Added a new class, Pg::CLI::pg_config.

- All classes now take an executable parameter so you can explicitly set the
  path to the executable. By default, classes look in the current path, and
  die if they cannot find the relevant executable.

- The psql execute_file method now accepts a Path::Class::File object for the
  file name.

- The psql execute_file method reused the same default ref for options
  repeatedly, causing weird bugs.
